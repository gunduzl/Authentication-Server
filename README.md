# Authentication-Server
The goal of this RESTful project is to have a FastAPI application that implements an authentication and authorization system inspired by Kerberos-like principles. This system includes features such as user authentication, token generation, key updates, and logging. The application is structured with specific routes, each serving a unique function.
